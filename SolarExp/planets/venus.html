            <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object
                in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight
                .Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk
                or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117
                Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other
                planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in
                the east.Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.</p>

            <p>
                Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun,
                and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets,
                consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of
                Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest
                surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
                highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light.</p>
