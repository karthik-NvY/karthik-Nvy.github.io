            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English,
                Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of
                the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical
                bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact
                craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>

            <p>
                The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative
                to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the
                Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere
                covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly
                shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft.
                Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15
                July 1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images of another
                planet from deep space.</p>
