            <p>
                Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
                the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
                Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
                The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the
                Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.</p>
            <p>
                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by
                empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational
                perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by
                John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within
                a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent
                size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August
                1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes
                with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.</p>
